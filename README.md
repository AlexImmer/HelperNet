# HelperNet

Using scanning for nearby people we produced an app that is capable of creating a real-time infrastructure to help people in emergency situations. Or rather help people helping each other in these situations. The infrastructure itself based on the p2pkit by Uepaa-AG enables small-scale communication networks to exchange data quickly. 

This first aid solution does not need registration, a server backend or other more complex infrastructure elements which makes it more flexible and even capable of helping out in emergency situations where you don't have a well established Network service such as on the countryside or crowded places.
